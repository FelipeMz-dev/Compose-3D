# Compose-3D
The project use drawScope to draw path poligons in a scene with drawPath calculating projection

**Matrix3x3:**
This objet calculate te position in vertex to give toation angle in poligons

**ZBuffer:**
Use the clipping technique to divide overlapping triangles and use the the Separating Axis Theorem to calculate the intersection in 3D scene
